Esports (also known as electronic sports, e-sports, or eSports) is a form of sport competition using video games.

Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players, individually or as teams. Although organized competitions have long been a part of video game culture, these were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when participation by professional gamers and spectatorship in these events through live streaming saw a large surge in popularity.

By the 2010s, esports was a significant factor in the video game industry, with many game developers actively designing and providing funding for tournaments and other events.

That includes big-money owners, a structured schedule, and things like minimum salaries and other benefits for players. The transformation started slowly, with European soccer clubs signing professional FIFA players to represent their teams in competition.
